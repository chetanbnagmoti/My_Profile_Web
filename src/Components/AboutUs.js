          <p>
            I am a Full Stack Developer and Team Leader with over 3 years of
            experience specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
            React.js, Node.js). Throughout my career, I have successfully led
            and developed numerous complex projects, delivering
            high-performance, scalable web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise lies in designing robust backend architectures,
            creating dynamic frontend interfaces, and integrating third-party
            platforms seamlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked extensively on complex API integrations, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Zoho ↔️ TempLogger</li>
            <li>TempLogger ↔️ Zoho</li>
            <li>Double Tick ↔️ Zoho</li>
            <li>Gati ↔️ Zoho</li>
            <li> Bigin Double Tick ↔️ Zoho Bigin</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During this period, I have written and optimized several intricate
            API logics and resolved countless challenging issues across both
            frontend and backend systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I continuously explore and learn modern technologies to enhance
            application performance and maintainability — including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>React Redux</b> for efficient global state management
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>React Query</b> for advanced caching and reducing redundant API
              calls
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I am passionate about clean code, scalable architecture, and
            continuous learning, always striving to deliver high-quality
            solutions that drive real business impact.
